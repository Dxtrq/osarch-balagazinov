# Ticket 1 — New developer starts Monday, needs a test machine

## 1. What was asked

## 2. What was actually needed

The request sounds simple, but it leaves out almost everything required for a usable test environment.

**What the request left out:**
- Which operating systems are needed (Linux, Windows, or both)
- How much RAM and CPU the host machine actually has
- Whether the machines need internet access
- Whether the developer needs to test communication between machines
- Whether a snapshot / rollback point is required
- Who will actually follow the instructions (Aigerim has never opened a hypervisor)

**Where the request itself was wrong:**  
Calling it “a test computer” implies **one** machine. For a developer who needs to “try things without breaking anything”, a single OS is not enough. Real testing almost always needs both a Linux server and a Windows client. One machine also cannot demonstrate network isolation or inter-guest communication.

**What I assumed instead of asking:**
- The host is a typical student laptop (mine has **16 GB RAM** and **6 cores / 12 threads**)
- The developer needs **both** Ubuntu Server and Windows 11 so he can test cross-platform behaviour
- Both guests must reach the internet **and** each other
- A clean snapshot is mandatory so the developer can break things and roll back
- The instructions must be written for someone who has never used VirtualBox

These assumptions shaped every decision below.

## 3. What I did

1. Measured the real host resources (16 GB RAM, 6 cores / 12 threads).
2. Chose VirtualBox as the hypervisor (see Decisions below).
3. Created two virtual machines:
   - `lab01-ubuntu` — Ubuntu Server 26.04.1 LTS, 2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM, 25 GB dynamic disk
   - `lab02-windows` — Windows 11 Enterprise Evaluation, 2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM, 64 GB dynamic disk, UEFI + Secure Boot + TPM
4. Put both machines on the same **NAT Network** so they can talk to each other and still reach the internet.
5. Added a Windows Firewall rule that allows ICMP (ping) without disabling the firewall.
6. Verified connectivity in both directions and to the internet.
7. Took a clean snapshot of the Ubuntu guest named `clean-install`.
8. Wrote a detailed `BUILD.md` that a non-technical person can follow.

### Resource calculation (from my real host)

| Resource | Host has | Given to Ubuntu | Given to Windows | Left for host |
|----------|----------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|
| RAM      | 16 GB    | 4 GB            | 4 GB             | ~8 GB         |
| CPU      | 12 threads | 2 vCPU        | 2 vCPU           | 8 threads     |

I never give more than half of the host’s cores to any single guest. 4 GB per guest leaves enough headroom so the host itself does not start swapping.

### Non-default settings (and why)

| Setting | Default in VirtualBox | What I chose | Why |
|---------|-----------------------|--------------|-----|
| Network mode | NAT | **NAT Network** | Ordinary NAT isolates each guest; they cannot ping each other. NAT Network keeps internet access **and** lets the two guests talk. |
| Windows firmware | BIOS | **UEFI + Secure Boot + TPM 2.0** | Windows 11 requires these three things. |
| Disk allocation | Pre-allocate full size | **Dynamically allocated** | Saves host disk space until the guest actually needs it. |
| Windows RAM | 2 GB (VirtualBox suggestion) | **4 GB** | Windows 11 is unusable under 4 GB for any real work. |
| Snapshot | None | **clean-install** | The whole point of a test machine is the ability to roll back after the developer breaks something. |

### Alternative considered

I also considered **VMware Workstation Player**.  
It is smoother with Windows guests and has better 3D support, but:

- The free Player version has more restrictions on snapshots and networking.
- VirtualBox is completely free for this use case and is already installed on most student machines.

I stayed with VirtualBox because the goal is a document that Aigerim can follow on a normal office laptop without buying anything.

## 4. Evidence

| File | What it proves |
|------|----------------|
| `evidence/01-new-vm-wizard.png` | Correct creation of the Windows 11 VM with the right type and version |
| `evidence/02-disk-settings.png` | Disk is 64 GB and dynamically allocated |
| `evidence/03-network-adapter.png` | Both guests are attached to the same NAT Network |
| `evidence/04-guest-uname.txt` | Ubuntu is running (`uname -a` + `lsb_release -a`) |
| `evidence/05-ping-between-guests.txt` | Ping works both directions + both machines reach the internet |
| `evidence/06-snapshot-list.png` | Snapshot `clean-install` exists and can be restored |

## 5. What I would do differently

I would prepare a one-page “cheat sheet” with only the five most important clicks and the exact numbers (RAM, CPU, disk size). The full `BUILD.md` is correct, but for a person who is in a hurry it is still long. A one-page version would reduce the chance of skipping a critical step.
